<i>Posted: June 29, 2021</i><br>
<i>Written by:
	<a target="_blank" rel="external" href="https://other.respdev.com/">Leon</a></i>
<h1>It's Alive!</h1>
<p>So we just updated the website, you can find out more in our <a href="https://respdev.com/blog/first-post">first-post</a>. The<br>main thing we got done since then has been fully scrapping the newsletter and<br>switching to a whole new blog system. I got to work on the backend whilst Shane<br>got it looking pretty (<em>and much more but I digress for the sake of comedy</em>).</p>
<p>Since we just got done getting the base of it implemented, if you spot anything<br>acting weird then please <a href="https://github.com/ResponsiveDev/main-site/issues/new">open an issue</a> so that we can fix it, thanks!</p>
<h1>Having Fun</h1>
<p>Once we got the blog all up-and-running I decided, <em>as all up programmers love<br>to do</em>, I want to make my version of the thing. In this case I'm on about the<br>website. Shane has put a lot of work into the site and has done amazing, but I<br>just wanted to give it a go (<em>don't worry, this will still be the main site</em>).<br>And so I did...</p>
<h2>Making it Fun</h2>
<p>Instead of using a framework, like <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev">svelte-kit</a> which is what the main site<br>uses, I wanted to do it the <em>good ol' fashion way</em>. This meant vanilla<br>JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The only extra thing I did use was <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org">TypeScript</a> as<br>it helped catch a good amount of errors without me spending another day on<br>the project.</p>
<p>When it came to the design, the new one that just released on the main site<br>looked good so I stuck with that, apart from a few key differences:</p>
<h3>Grid</h3>
<p>Grids are great when you use them right, and while I can't say I used them<br>right, I did use them. These are what hold the foundation of the layout<br>together. If you look at the main site compared with this one you'll set that<br>it has much stricter content width, <code>80ch</code> to be exact.</p>
<h3>Font</h3>
<p>This is not so much about the font as it is about the typography decisions. I<br>went for a line height of <code>1.4</code> for content and <code>1.2</code> for headings. This allows<br>the content to breath and tay readable across devices. This along with the<br><code>80ch</code> makes is super easy to read for desktop to mobile.</p>
<h3>Less Styling</h3>
<p>While it sounds like I messed around with the styles a lot, I really didn't. I<br>kept it as default as I could whilst still making it unique and pleasant to<br>look at.</p>
<h3>Less Scripting</h3>
<p>Just like with the styles, I kept the scripting to a minimum too. The only<br>thing that actually uses and requires the use of it is the blog (<em>at the moment<br>that is</em>), so that's all I did.</p>
<h2>Into the Code</h2>
<p>If you take a look in the <a href="https://github.com/ResponsiveDev/leon-site">repo</a><br>you can pretty much figure out how I did everything. First came the HTML<br>files with their bits of CSS, then I moved onto the blog which needed some<br>JS/TS. That's really it, nothing crazy. I do recommend having a look around<br>to see how it work, especially if you're a beginner, you might learn something<br>new.</p>
<p>Since there's not much to talk about in regards to the actual code, I'll let<br>it speak for itself. If you do have any questions then please feel free to ask<br>me in the <strong>discord</strong> server, don't forget to ping me when you do (<code>@Leonski</code>).<br>If there's anything interesting that gets brought up I'll be sure to add it<br>here for others to see.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>All-in-all it took me a few hours to get the site to where it is now, including<br>the few extra commits I pushed before writing this post. That's not too bad,<br>although I did have full knowledge of how the blog worked as so on. Nonetheless,<br>it was great fun and I even encourage you do give it a go with something you<br>use.</p>
<p>You can find the website <a href="https://leon.respdev.com">here</a>, and I'll continue to<br>update it as the main site also updates.</p>
<p>Have a great day and I'll see you in the next one!</p>
