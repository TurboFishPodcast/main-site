The\\r\\nmain thing we got done since then has been fully scrapping the newsletter and\\r\\nswitching to a whole new blog system. I got to work on the backend whilst Shane\\r\\ngot it looking pretty (*and much more but I digress for the sake of comedy*).\\r\\n\\r\\nSince we just got done getting the base of it implemented, if you spot anything\\r\\nacting weird then please [open an issue] so that we can fix it, thanks!\\r\\n\\r\\n# Having Fun\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce we got the blog all up-and-running I decided, *as all up programmers love\\r\\nto do*, I want to make my version of the thing. In this case I'm on about the\\r\\nwebsite. Shane has put a lot of work into the site and has done amazing, but I\\r\\njust wanted to give it a go (*don't worry, this will still be the main site*).\\r\\nAnd so I did...\\r\\n\\r\\n## Making it Fun\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead of using a framework, like [svelte-kit] which is what the main site\\r\\nuses, I wanted to do it the *good ol' fashion way*. This meant vanilla \\r\\nJavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The only extra thing I did use was [TypeScript] as\\r\\nit helped catch a good amount of errors without me spending another day on\\r\\nthe project.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen it came to the design, the new one that just released on the main site\\r\\nlooked good so I stuck with that, apart from a few key differences:\\r\\n\\r\\n### Grid\\r\\n\\r\\nGrids are great when you use them right, and while I can't say I used them\\r\\nright, I did use them. These are what hold the foundation of the layout\\r\\ntogether. If you look at the main site compared with this one you'll set that\\r\\nit has much stricter content width, `80ch` to be exact.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Font\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is not so much about the font as it is about the typography decisions. I\\r\\nwent for a line height of `1.4` for content and `1.2` for headings. This allows\\r\\nthe content to breath and tay readable across devices. This along with the\\r\\n`80ch` makes is super easy to read for desktop to mobile.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Less Styling\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile it sounds like I messed around with the styles a lot, I really didn't. I\\r\\nkept it as default as I could whilst still making it unique and pleasant to\\r\\nlook at.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Less Scripting\\r\\n\\r\\nJust like with the styles, I kept the scripting to a minimum too.

The Issue was, some people in the Discord server didn't even know our site existed! How much for a main hub huh? I think the main reason for this was due to poor site design (both UI\u002FUX and code-wise). For example, to update an event on the events page, I would need to convert the Discord message to HTML using an external site, input the due date in UTC in \u003Cstrong\u003Etwo places\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E, make sure everything was rendered correctly, go back and fix everything (this is what happens when you don't have an internal converter), then push the changes to GitHub.

Instead of being &quot;about the community&quot; as I had claimed, it was actually just a mishmash of random articles from other people, a few updates, and a heap of other (sometimes outdated) event details. Another issue on top of that was that because of the code structure, we had to name files with a specific syntax to get them to show up. Unlike we do now, we did not have the power to have metadata in YAML.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\\n\u003Cp\u003EYou heard that right, our blog posts (yes, \u003Cstrong\u003EBLOG\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E posts) have support for quite a few metadata tricks in YAML. For example, the date and author info at the top of the page, that's all YAML.
